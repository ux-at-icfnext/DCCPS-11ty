### Button Group (segmented)
{% assign button-group = btn-group %}
{% include "patterns/button/button.md" %}

The button group makes it easy to put multiple buttons together. There are two options for the grouping. The default grouping creates a small margin between the buttons. The segmented button group has no space between the buttons. This is done by adding `usa-button-group--segmented` class to the `<ul>`.

## Code Example

```html
  <ul class="usa-button-group">
    <li class="usa-button-group__item">
      <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="usa-button usa-button--outline"
        >Back</a
      >
    </li>
    <li class="usa-button-group__item">
      <button type="button" class="usa-button">Continue</button>
    </li>
  </ul>
```

## Library & Prototyping
In most cases, you can just add the html for a button where you need it. However, the button group pattern makes it easy to add multiple buttons and should be used with two or more buttons. __IMPORTANT__ the button group pattern is using links not buttons, please keep that in mind if using with forms.

To implement a button group into the page you first need to create the content and settings. This can be done through the front matter.

### Settings
Settings are optional parameters that can be added to control styling and to set a reference. The reference is needed for using multiple groups if accordions on a page.

<div class="usa-table" >

| setting | value |
| ------ | ------ |
| segment | true/false (defaults to false) |
| class | allows adding a custom class to the `ul` elements. |
</div>


### Content
<div class="usa-table" >

| name | description | required |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| link | url link to destination | <i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> |
| text | button label | <i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> |
| class |  add any styling classes to your button | <i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i>  |
</div>

### Front matter example

```yaml
  button:
    - link: "/"
      text: don't click me
      class: usa-button--outline
    - link: "/"
      text: click me
```

**Using settings**
```yaml
  button-group:
    set:
      segment: true
      class: my-cool-class
    btn:
      - link: "/"
        text: don't click me
        class: usa-button--outline
      - link: "/"
        text: click me
```

### Add pattern to the page
simply include the button pattern ```{{ snippet }}``` and it will automatically use a "button" or "button-group" assigned in the front matter. 

If you need to create multiple buttons/button group ... make sure to assign the name of your button array.
```liguid
  {{ spit-assigned }}
```

For a button group:
```yaml
  {{ spit-assigned-group }}
```
